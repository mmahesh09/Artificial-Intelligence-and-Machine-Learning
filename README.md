## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a subdomain of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing systems that learn or improve performance, based on the data. Artificial intelligence is a broad word that refers to systems or machines that resemble human intelligence. A crucial distinction is that, while all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning. We mainly use machine learning to achieve AI.
