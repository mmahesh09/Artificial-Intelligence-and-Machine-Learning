# Decision Tree

A decision tree is a machine learning model used for classification and regression tasks. It represents decisions and their possible consequences in a tree-like structure, where each internal node corresponds to a decision rule, each branch represents an outcome of that rule, and each leaf node represents a final decision or prediction.
