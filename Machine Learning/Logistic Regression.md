# Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. Despite its name, it is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. It predicts the probability of an outcome belonging to a specific category, typically binary categories like 0 or 1, yes or no, spam or not spam.

## Logistic Regression Equations
Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification. It predicts the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., 0 or 1) based on one or more input features.

1. Hypothesis Function
The hypothesis of logistic regression is represented by the sigmoid function applied to a linear combination of inputs
