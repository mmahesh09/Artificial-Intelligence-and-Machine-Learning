# Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. Despite its name, it is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm. It predicts the probability of an outcome belonging to a specific category, typically binary categories like 0 or 1, yes or no, spam or not spam.
